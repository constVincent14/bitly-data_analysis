# bitly-data_analysis

Data used in this repository is from Wes McKinney's book: Python for Data Analysis Chapter 14.1 USA.gov Data from Bitly. The data contains records of user who shorten
links that ends with .gov or .mil; In this repository, I performed some basic analysis on the data. The first one is to find which time zones most users use to perform
URL shortening. The second is to find what operating system most users use to perform URL shortening and grouping them by each of available time zones in the data.
